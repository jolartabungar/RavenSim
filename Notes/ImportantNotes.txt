In the current code inherited, there is a problem with the GUI.

I am currently having issues, when you place a device into the environment,
if you try and change the location by dragging it, the ports for the device
does not move with the device.

To get around it, I made a temporary fix, making sure the new devices created
cannot be moved. 

In the future, these devices need to be updated and this bug needs fixing.

Below are the devices which were added and cannot be moved once placed
Note: These devices will be updated for every device created in the repo

HalfAdder
FullAdder
HalfSubtractor
FullSUbtractor
Eight to three encoder
Three to Eight decoder
Two to One mux
Four to One mux
One to Two demux
One to Four demux
JK Flip Flop with Preset and Clear 


Important Note:
The logic for the RS flip flop and JK flip flop were already created in the
client.
Logic was added in the server only to create the circuits needed for the Flip Flops



When Bug is fixed,
Go to ComponentFactory.jsx to make the changes, 
after this, the devices should be able to move.
