To Do:
Detailed project milestones (just update it)
For the Progress Report design it such that offshore coder's are able to reproduce the result??
Get Writing Done sooner than later
Detail the different requirements, implementation specific details can come later.

How do we write Final Report: 
One big happy report JUST FOR OUR GROUP
    - Mainly focused on how we are able to save/load don't really need to talk about the other groups
Each person's contribution should be documented.

Oral Presentation mixed with poster fair in March showing the product working.
We will need to show Save/Restore working
Aim to have documentation sufficient in final report by then
    - This has to include the testing, implementation, design choices, etc.
